# DBMail

Trying to automatically retrieve all my [Deutsche Bahn](https://www.bahn.de) ticket bookings from my GMail account and turn them into something easily analyzable. Use the [GMail Python API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) (‚Üê that page also explains how to get the credentials).
